# mangadownloader
manga downloader automatically from a predefined source

Here i have used the solo leveling as an example.

The source URL is: https://ww1.mangafreak.me/Manga/Solo_Leveling
user need add the main URL with the manga reading list like this: https://ww1.mangafreak.me/Manga/Solo_Leveling

After that the script will ask the start chapter number and end chapter number to download.

Automatically all mentioned files will be downloaded. Just unzip and enjoy.

Usage: ./mangadownloader.sh https://ww1.mangafreak.me/Manga/Solo_Leveling

Note: Please do not use this spam the site or give heavy load on the source URL server as we dont have the reliable source. If anything happens i or github will not be responsible. You are on your own.
