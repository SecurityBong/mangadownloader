# mangadownloader
manga downloader automatically from a predefined source

The source URL is: https://ww1.mangafreak.me

Here i have used the solo leveling as an example.

User need add the main URL with the manga reading list like this: https://ww1.mangafreak.me/Manga/Solo_Leveling

After that the script will ask the start chapter number and end chapter number to download.

Automatically all mentioned files will be downloaded.

**Usage:** python mangadownloader.py

Note: Please do not use this to spam the site or give heavy load on the source URL server as we dont have the reliable source. If anything happens me or github will not be responsible. You are on your own.
